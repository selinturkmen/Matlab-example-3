% It can be said that the number in the histogram are normally distributed
% with the desired mean and varience. To call the distribution "normal"
% 68% of numbers should be in between [mean-variance, mean+variance] and
% 95% of the numbers should be in between [mean-(2*variance),mean+(2*variance)]. 
% In addition the shape of histogram should look like a "Bell". 
% Due to random generated numbers, mean and verience will differ with each
% run, however, each of them will meet the conditions.
